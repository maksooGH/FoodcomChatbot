    "name": "Gelatin",
    "desc": "Gelatin is a natural, soluble protein obtained by partial hydrolysis of Collagen from animal or fish bones, skin, and tendons. The hydrolysis process allows the bonds between individual collagen molecules to be broken. The molecules are isolated using hot water or acids and then Gelatin is filtered, sterilized and dried. The final product consists of glycine, proline and hydroxyproline. There are two basic types of Gelatin: food-grade gelatin, which is thermally soluble in water and available in three forms, and Hydrolyzed Collagen, which is soluble only in cold water, does not gel, and is available in powder form. Gelatin as a food additive has the symbol E441.",
    "techs": "Gelatin is almost colorless, odorless and tasteless. It is very soluble in water. When dry, Gelatin is in the form of powder, sheets, or flakes; when wet, it has a gummy consistency. It is known for its gelling ability and viscosity. It can also be used as an emulsifier and thickener. Gelatin also contributes to the proper functioning of bones and joints.",
    "shelf": "The shelf life of Gelatin is 12 months.",
    "packaging": "Foodcom S.A. offers Gelatin in 25 kg bags.",
    "applications": "Gelatin is mainly used in the food industry. Like E441, it is used to give food the right texture. Food Gelatin is an emulsifier, stabilizer or thickener and is added to cold delicatessen products such as meat pies and sausage jellies. It is also found in fruit jellies, yogurts, cottage cheese and dairy desserts. Gelatin also gives sauces a glossy appearance and smooth texture."
