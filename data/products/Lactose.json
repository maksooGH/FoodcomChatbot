    "desc": "Lactose is a natural milk sugar. It makes up 3,5-5,0% of cow’s milk and can be extracted by a filtration process with the use of centrifuges. The product goes through a series of washing steps in order to separate the lactose from the proteins, minerals, and debris. Then it is crystallized and crushed.",
    "techs": "The final Lactose product appears in a pure form of a free-flowing fine powder of light yellow color. Lactose often serves as a texture enhancer, emulsifier, and water-binding agent. Foodcom can provide its Business Partners with different lactose grade suitable for multiple applications.",
    "shelf": "The shelf life of Lactose is 24 months. The product should be stored in a dry environment at a maximum temperature of 30°C.",
    "packaging": "Foodcom supplies its Business Partners with Lactose in 25 kg bags or in Big bags.",
    "applications": "Lactose is one of the best dairy ingredients for food and feed applications due to its delicate taste, white color, and low content of calories. It has great taste- and flavor-enhancing properties. Lactose preserves its crystallized structure without over-sweetening the final product. Its cost-effectiveness, low hygroscopicity, and water solubility contribute to its popularity. Lactose can also be used in the manufacturing of pastry, confectionery, chocolates, baked goods, meat industry, and dietary nutrition."
