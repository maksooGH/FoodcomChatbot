    "name": "Sodium Nitrate",
    "desc": "Sodium Nitrate is an inorganic chemical compound, more specifically, a salt of nitric acid and sodium. Sodium Nitrate occurs in nature as the mineral nitronatrite. Industrially, it is produced by neutralizing nitric acid with either sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, or sodium hydroxide. Sodium Nitrate is most commonly used in fertilizers, but also in food, where it is a preservative called E251.",
    "techs": "Sodium Nitrate is in the form of an odorless white granule. It is highly soluble in water and has strong hygroscopic and oxidizing properties. Sodium Nitrate is a preservative in food, which is converted to nitrite and in this form inhibits bacterial growth. Sodium Nitrate in its molten form, as well as its solutions mixed with potassium nitrate, has excellent thermal stability and high heat capacity, which makes it a valuable ingredient in explosive materials.",
    "shelf": "The shelf life of Sodium Nitrate is approximately two years.",
    "packaging": "Foodcom supplies its Business Partners with Sodium Nitrate in 25 kg bags and Big Bags.",
    "applications": "Sodium Nitrate is mainly used in fertilizers as it is a water-soluble source of nitrogen for NPK fertilizers. Nitrogen stimulates plant growth and contributes to the development of strong leaves, stems and roots. In addition, it does not alter the pH of the soil. Thanks to its thermal stability, Sodium Nitrate is also widely used in explosives."
