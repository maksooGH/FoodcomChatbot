    "name": "Sucralose",
    "desc": "Sucralose, also known as E955 in the food industry, is a synthetic sweetener produced from Sucrose. It is produced by the chlorination of Sucrose. It is a sweetener that is almost completely broken down by the body, so it is calorie-free, although it tastes much sweeter than sucrose. It is easily soluble in water.",
    "techs": "Sucralose comes mainly in the form of an odorless white powder. Unlike other natural sweeteners such as stevia or Xylitol, Sucralose is completely calorie-free and about 600 times sweeter than regular sugar. In addition, it leaves no bitter aftertaste. It dissolves very well in water and is resistant to both low and high temperatures. The structure of Sucralose differs from that of Sucrose because the three hydroxyl groups have been converted into three chlorine atoms, which has a significant impact on the properties, effect and metabolism of this sweetener.",
    "shelf": "The shelf life of Sucralose is 4 years.",
    "packaging": "Foodcom S.A. offers Sucralose in 25 kg bags.",
    "applications": "Due to its properties, Sucralose is widely used in the food industry, especially in low-calorie products and products for diabetics. It is found in diet foods, but also in desserts, frozen foods, dairy products, jellies or chewing gum. Due to its good solubility, Sucralose is used as a sweetener for beverages, and because of its resistance to high temperatures, it is used in the confectionery industry to sweeten baked goods."
