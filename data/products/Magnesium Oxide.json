    "name": "Magnesium Oxide",
    "desc": "Magnesium Oxide is an inorganic magnesium salt composed of magnesium and oxygen. It occurs naturally in the form of the mineral periclase, but is also obtained by burning magnesium or by roasting magnesite (magnesium carbonate) or dolomite. It is an ingredient in many commercial magnesium preparations, as it is a mineral needed for the proper functioning of countless processes in living organisms. As an additive in foods, it is listed under the number E530.",
    "techs": "Magnesium Oxide is an inorganic compound that belongs to the basic oxides. Magnesium Oxide has the form of a white, crystalline and hygroscopic substance. It is poorly soluble in water, but readily soluble in acids. Magnesium Oxide is characterized by its resistance even at high temperatures and is corrosion resistant. It has high thermal conductivity but low electrical conductivity.",
    "shelf": "The shelf life of Magnesium Oxide is two years.",
    "packaging": "Foodcom S.A. offers Magnesium Oxide in 25 kg bags.",
    "applications": "Magnesium is an important mineral in the diet of farm animals, especially cattle and sheep. Its absence or deficiency can cause grass tetany and other disorders, and it is also used to reduce stress in animals. Magnesium Oxide can be used in medicine and pharmaceuticals â€“ it helps with digestive problems. It is also an ingredient in dietary supplements for people who are deficient in this mineral, and it supports the normal function of the human body. As a food additive, E530 is an anti-caking agent."
