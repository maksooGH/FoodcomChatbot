    "name": "Cagliata",
    "desc": "Cagliata is a rennet-added pasteurized cheese made from cow’s milk with a fat content of 45 to 48%. The production of Cagliata is based on the coagulation of pasteurized milk with microbial rennet – this starts the process of fat coagulation. The Cagliata obtained in this way is dried and formed into blocks that are immersed in a salt solution. The product is then formed into a rectangular block with evenly spaced holes. The cheese is commonly known as an intermediate product for other cheeses, such as Mozzarella. It can also be consumed directly. In the case of Cagliata, which is used to make other cheeses, it is cut into smaller pieces, which are then crushed in a salt solution. Later, the resulting mass is stretched and the final product is formed.",
