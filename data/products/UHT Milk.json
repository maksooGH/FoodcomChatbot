    "name": "UHT Milk",

During the production of UHT Milk, a Maillard reaction occurs, which leads to a change in color, taste and/or odor. After opening, it should be stored in the fridge.",
    "shelf": "The shelf life of UHT Milk is up to 9 months depending on the method and temperature of pasteurization.",
    "packaging": "UHT Milk should be stored in sterile, light-free containers, preferably in non-transparent plastic or cardboard boxes.",
    "applications": "UHT Milk can be used as the base-line product for the majority of dairy segments. Depending on the process, it is used in the production of yogurts, butters, cheeses, creams, and many more."
