    "name": "Permeate",
    "desc": "Permeate is produced from fresh pasteurized skim milk, formed after the ultrafiltration of milk in the process of sweet cheese production to extract proteins and fats. The product is then dried using advanced spray drying techniques. The product is sometimes called “deproteinized whey” when it is obtained from whey.",
    "techs": "Permeate is commonly used as a bulking agent, it gives great flavor support, and reduces hygroscopicity. Whey permeate is also characterized by very good fluidity. It enables the formation of stable emulsions, moisture retention, and fat content reduction.",
    "shelf": "The shelf life of Permeate is about 18 months. The product should be stored in a dry, clean warehouse with a max. temperature of 25°C and relative humidity max. 75%.",
    "packaging": "Foodcom supplies its Business Partners with Permeate in 25 kg bags or in Big-bags.",
    "applications": "Thanks to the fact that whey permeate is rich in lactose but low in protein, it can be used in the manufacturing of sweets, baking goods, chocolate, dry mixes, and fats. It is also added to the production of ice cream, processed cheese, drinks, meats, and cosmetics."
