    "name": "Citric Acid",
    "desc": "Citric Acid occurs naturally in citrus fruits such as lemons, oranges, black currants, strawberries, and pineapples. Citric Acid is also found in most organisms, where it plays an important function in the burning of carbohydrates. It can also be produced chemically – industrially it is mainly produced by fermentation or chemical reaction. It is used in about 90% of the world’s production and is produced by fermentation using enzymes and strains of bacteria, most commonly Aspergillus niger. It can occur as Citric Acid monohydrate or anhydrous.",
    "techs": "Citric Acid is in the form of white, odorless crystals and has a rather pronounced sour taste. It is an acidity regulator – when added to production, it is responsible for lowering the pH and thus also acts as a preservative, as acidification can extend shelf life. Citric Acid then makes it possible to enhance the sour taste of foods, so that the products have a more acidic taste. It is an antioxidant and has a bleaching effect that affects the color of fruits and vegetables. It has the ability to stabilize emulsions and prevent fat separation.",
    "shelf": "The shelf life of Citric Acid is approximately 3 years. The product should be stored in a dry, cool warehouse",
    "packaging": "Foodcom S.A. offers Citric Acid in 25 kg bags.",
    "applications": "Citric Acid as a food additive functions as E330. It is an excellent preservative added to canned and preserved products to keep them fresh. It also serves as a binder and thickener in sauces, creams, jellies, jams and marmalades. In confectionery and baked goods, it improves the leavening power of the baking soda. It is also an important ingredient in cheese and beer production."
