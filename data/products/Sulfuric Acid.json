    "name": "Sulfuric Acid",
    "desc": "Sulfuric Acid is an inorganic chemical compound. It is a strong acids, composed of sulfur, oxygen and hydrogen elements. Sulfuric Acid does not occur in nature – because of its affinity for water vapor. It is obtained synthetically – on an industrial scale, by the conventional contact process of oxidation of sulfur dioxide. The process can be divided into three stages: the generation of sulfur dioxide, its oxidation to sulfur trioxide, and then the absorption of sulfur trioxide to oleum, which is then diluted with water to form concentrated Sulfuric Acid. As a food additive, it is referred to as E513.",
    "techs": "Anhydrous Sulfuric Acid is a colorless, viscous, and oily liquid that is heavier than water. It has strong hygroscopic properties and absorbs water from its surroundings and even from some compounds. Sulfuric Acid is very reactive and corrosive. It acts as a catalyst, dehydrating agent or pH regulator.",
    "shelf": "The shelf life of Sulfuric Acid is 12 months.",
    "packaging": "Foodcom supplies its Business Partners with Sulfuric Acid in bulk.",
    "applications": "The most common use of Sulfuric Acid is to participate in the production of fertilizers. It acidifies water and provides improved soil quality and increased plant growth. It is usually used in the production of superphosphates, ammonium phosphate and ammonium sulfates."
