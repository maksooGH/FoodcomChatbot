    "name": "Maasdam",
    "desc": "Maasdam is made from pasteurized cow’s milk. It is a Swiss-style Dutch rennet cheese characterized by a faster maturation process than other Dutch cheeses. Maasdam usually matures for over at least 4 weeks. Maasdam can be used as a less expensive substitute for Emmental.",
    "techs": "Maasdam cheese contains more moisture than Emmental and is thus more tender. It has a soft, creamy texture and is especially known for its excellent melting properties. It is widely chosen by the manufacturers for its cost-effectiveness and easy use. The cheese is elastic, firm, and homogeneous with oval, regularly spaced eyes of various sizes, and yellow rind. The holes appear thanks to the development of propionic bacteria responsible for the characteristic flavor. Maasdam is sometimes waxed. It has a delicate nutty, sweet, and slightly spice taste.",
    "shelf": "The shelf life of Maasdam is about 6 months. The product should be stored in a dark place, at a temperature between 2 °C and 10 °C and relative humidity of about 65%.",
    "packaging": "Foodcom supplies its Business Partners with Maasdam in 13 kg blocks.",
    "applications": "Maasdam is suitable for direct consumption in sandwiches, paninis, and bagels as well as a table snack or on-the-go product. Maasdam is also suitable for grating, shredding, and slicing. In addition, it is used as an ingredient in bakery goods, pre-made dishes, sauces, dips, pizza toppings, and soups."
