    "name": "Glycerol",
    "desc": "Glycerol, also known as Glycerin, is a type of carbohydrate called a sugar alcohol or polyol. In terms of structure, it is the simplest trivalent alcohol. Natural sources of Glycerol include vegetable fats and animal fats. It can also be obtained synthetically by chlorination of propylene. Because glycerin is one of natureâ€™s most valuable and versatile chemicals, it is used in a variety of industries as a humectant, plasticizer, emollient, sweetener, bulking agent in low-fat foods, and more. As a food additive, it has the symbol E422.",
    "techs": "Glycerol is an odorless, colorless and viscous liquid with a sweet taste. Because of its three hydroxyl groups, it is completely miscible with water. When exposed to humid air, Glycerol is highly hygroscopic and absorbs water as well as some gasses. Glycerol has moisturizing and degreasing properties in low concentrations, while it has disinfecting and drying properties in high concentrations.",
    "shelf": "The shelf life of Glycerol is 24 months. The product can be stored at room temperature.",
    "packaging": "Foodcom provides its Business Partners with Glycerol in liquid form, in IBC type containers.",
    "applications": "In the food industry, Glycerol can be used as a solvent for flavors and food colors. In foods, it is a humectant, an emulsifier, and maintains the desired moisture content of products; for example, it protects baked goods from drying out. As E422, it is a preservative because it binds water, limiting the growth of pathogenic microorganisms."
