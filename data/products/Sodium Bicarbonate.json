    "name": "Sodium Bicarbonate",
    "desc": "Sodium Bicarbonate is an inorganic chemical compound, a hydrogen salt of carbonic acid and sodium. It is prepared by adding carbon dioxide to sodium carbonate. On an industrial scale, it is obtained by the Solvaying method. Sodium Bicarbonate is commonly known as baking soda. As a food additive, it has the symbol E500b. It has foaming properties and acts as a raising agent, so it is used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries.",
    "techs": "Sodium Bicarbonate is in the form of white crystalline powder or colorless crystals. It is odorless and has a slightly salty taste. It has an alkaline reaction, which is why it is often used in therapy to restore the body’s pH balance. Sodium Bicarbonate absorbs odors and moisture and softens water. It also has fluffing, foaming and antifungal properties.",
    "shelf": "The shelf life of Sodium Bicarbonate is 24 months. The product must be stored in a cool, dry place and at room temperature.",
    "packaging": "Foodcom supplies its Business Partners with Sodium Bicarbonate in 25 kg, Big Bags, and bulk.",
    "applications": "Sodium Bicarbonate is mainly used in the food industry and is known as baking soda. It is a leavening agent in baking – the reaction between baking soda and acid leads to the release of carbon dioxide, which causes the batter to expand and develop its characteristic texture. In addition, Sodium Bicarbonate also acts as a raising agent in baking by thermally decomposing and producing carbon dioxide."
